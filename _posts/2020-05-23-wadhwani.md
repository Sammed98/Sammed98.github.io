title: Joining Wadhwani AI

Have you ever wondered what you wanted to do in life? I often find myself going down a rabbit hole whenever I think about it. Often, I end up finalizing on anything where I can improve someone's life; at [Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence][WIAIhome], I will.

Who/What is Wadhwani AI? It's a non-profit research lab based in India, working on social good using AI; solving problems such as: reducing child mortality by improving the screening for low-birth-weight babies; improving Tuberculosis care by improving case estimations and better prioritization of patients; and easing the ability to manage pests in cotton farms by providing pesticide dose recommendations to farmers.

Today's post is on my new role as a Research Fellow at Wadhwani AI, joining remotely on the 1st of June. I am unaware of the project I will work on, but I am pretty excited about it; it might be a new project altogether!

Research Fellows contribute to all the stages of a project; it varies from understanding the problem to ideating to building the solutions. In doing so, they perfect the art to develop solutions by working closely with all the stakeholders involved&mdash;be it customers, partners, technical teams, program managers, researchers, or designers.

I am blessed to have got the opportunity to be a Research Fellow at Wadhwani AI. I believe I will be learning a lot from my stint at Wadhwani, also realizing my wish to help people.

During my undergrad studies, I started learning machine learning as a tool in solutions; I was inspired by the [documentary on Deepmind's AlphaGo][DMalphaGO]&mdash;a computer program that beat the world champion of Go in 2016. I believe that artificial intelligence is the tool of the era, and if we can train a computer to beat the world champion, we can train it to help us make better decisions.

At Wadhwani AI, I will be contributing my share to our moonshot of helping millions of neglected people.
